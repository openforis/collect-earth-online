        <h2>Email policy</h2>
        <p>
          By creating an institution you become an &quot;admin&quot; user for that institution.
          Doing so will automatically subscribe you for the mailing list. This mailing list is run
          through a service called <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/">HubSpot</a>. You will be able
          to unsubscribe by clicking &quot;unsubscribe&quot; from within any email from CEO. In
          addition, any user that you make an admin of your institution will be added to the mailing
          list.
        </p>
        <p>
          The content of the emails from the mailing list will be limited to updates about features
          and release dates, with the very occasional feedback survey.
        </p>
        <p>Your email will not be shared with any third party organization.</p>
