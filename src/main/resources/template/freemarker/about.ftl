        <h1>About Collect Earth Online</h1>
        <p>
            Collect Earth Online is a custom built, open-source, high
            resolution satellite image viewing and interpretation
            system developed by SERVIR as a tool for use in projects
            that require land cover and/or land use reference data.
            Collect Earth Online promotes consistency in locating,
            interpreting, and labeling reference data plots for use in
            classifying and monitoring land cover / land use change.
            The full functionality of Collect Earth Online, including
            collaborative compilation of reference point databases, is
            implemented online so there is no need for desktop
            installation. The Collect Earth Online codebase has been
            shared with the Open Foris Initiative of the Food And
            Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.
