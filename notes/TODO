   11. Ask Jerome to update survey card CSS
   12. Record imagery timestamp when plot values are saved
   13. Ask Stefano to fix the buggy project creation algorithm in Collect

   19. Make sure Stefano fixes timeout with Project creation
   20. Merge ceo and ceo2 database on machiavelli (resume in ~/geek/code/clojure/merge-ceo-projects/)
       - keep ceo2:Demo Institution CEO Webinar April
       - nuke ceo2:everything else
       - copy over ceo:everything
       - if user accounts collide, retain new passwords
   21. Migrate ceo to machiavelli (increase the -Xmx value for its JVM and ensure that the app auto-starts at boot)
   22. Ask Jeff to redirect ceo.sig-gis.com to machiavelli
   23. Ask Alfonso to redirect collect.earth (etc) to machiavelli
   24. CEO + Collect:
       - Collection :: Go to Next Plot stays on same plot
       - Project :: Gridded sample distribution does not create points correctly
** And onward
  - Project properties don't load on ceo/project/# until the project is published
  - Remove second call to get-unanalyzed-plot-byid in project.{ftl,js}
  - Ask Stefano to include the institution attribute in returned imagery objects
  - Make sure project creation calculates the number of plots and samples per plot
  - Add the new features (e.g., pro-active sampling) to our embedded database.
  - Change style of imagery on institution page based on public:true/false attribute
  - Prevent imagery deletion if any created or published projects use it as their basemap (but not closed or archived projects)
  - Remove deploy/clientkeystore file from version control and add config settings to mail-config.json and web.xml to include your own HTTPS certificate
  - Give CEO's Tomcat process more memory
  - Ask Stefano about the C:\Users\<username>\OpenForis\Collect\data directory
  - Alfonso shared this GEE grid generation script: https://code.earthengine.google.com/8809a49aba2386b651eafa25f97f39e4
  - Add Google Earth Engine Assets Support as a layer
  - Export of the data from collect directly from project Dashboard, doing it the same as collect--CSV or ZIP; he can get code from stefano
  - AOI of collection as a shapefile, name of country, district, or region--they already have a script in GEE--could Gary interface to that script; or maybe just a button with a tutorial as workaround
  - Work on QA/QC--compare operators against the plots--this is a big task/separate module
  - Check Karis' manual to make sure the DigitalGlobeWMSImagery CONNECTIDs are not present
  - Rebuild and deploy docker image
  - Review Githika's new spreadsheet and give her a new set of tasks
  - Move the CEO data directory to ~/.ceodb
  - Add logging with timestamps

It would be pretty cool to also have the confusion/error matrices calculated in mapcha (with the ability to insert new columns for new prediction results since model building is an iterative process).
