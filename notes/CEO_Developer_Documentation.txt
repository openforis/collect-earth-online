The source code for CEO can be found on Github at this URL:

Here is a high level description of CEO's system architecture:

CEO, Collect, and OfUsers are three separate web applications written in
Java+Javascript and deployed as WAR files, which are to be run together
within a single application server, such as Tomcat. To install and
configure all of these applications on your development machine, follow
the instructions in the repository's toplevel README.org file.

HTTP requests are received by Tomcat and passed to the appropriate
application based on the url path.

http://server.domain/ceo      -> CEO
http://server.domain/collect  -> Collect
http://server.domain/of-users -> OfUsers

On the back end, CEO uses the Spark framework for request routing and
the Freemarker Template Language (FTL) for rendering dynamic HTML from
templates. On the front end, CEO's web UI is written in HTML5, CSS3, and
Javascript with the AngularJS framework (v1). Dynamic maps are embedded
in the browser with OpenLayers 3.

Here are the relevant directories:

The Java files under src/main/java/org/openforis/ceo are separated
into 7 packages below org.openforis.ceo. Here's the breakdown for
future reference:

CEO's entry point is CeoSparkFilter.java, which extracts some runtime
configuration values from src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml and assigns
them to attributes in CeoConfig.java. After that, control is passed to
Server.java's init() method, which simply calls
Server.declareRemoteStorageRoutes(). This function uses Spark's static
get() and post() functions to setup the routing table for all future
incoming HTTP requests.

Requests for viewable pages respond with calls to the relevant method
within Views.java. All other requests are API calls to be used by the
client side of the application, generally returning JSON to front end
callback functions.

TimeSync integration with CEO will likely follow the same path as the
GeoDash integration:

1. Clone the CEO repository from Github and create a new branch called
   "timesync" on which to apply your changes.

2. Create a new Freemarker Template Language file at
   src/main/resources/template/freemarker/timesync.ftl to hold your page
   layout. Remember to include header.ftl, start-content.ftl,
   end-content.ftl, and footer.ftl.

3. Place the relevant styles for your page in a new CSS file at
   src/main/resources/public/css/timesync.css.

4. Use a Freemarker conditional block to load css/timesync.css in
   src/main/resources/template/freemarker/header.ftl:

   <#if navlink == "TimeSync">
   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="${root}/css/timesync.css">
   </#if>

5. Add a route for your new page to Server.java's
   declareLocalStorageRoutes() and declareRemoteStorageRoutes()
   functions:

   get("/timesync", (req, res) -> { return freemarker.render(Views.timesync(req, res)); });

6. Add a new timesync function to Views.java:

   public static ModelAndView timesync(Request req, Response res) {
        Map<String, Object> model = getBaseModel(req, "TimeSync");
        // Pass server-side parameters to your FTL template...
        model.put("some_variable", req.queryParams("some_value"));
        return new ModelAndView(model, "timesync.ftl");
    }

7. Place the Javascript for your page in a new file in
   src/main/resources/public/js/timesync.js.

8. Add a script tag in the body of your timesync.ftl file to load
   timesync.js:

   <script type="text/javascript" src="${root}/js/timesync.js"></script>

9. Keep editing the contents of timesync.ftl, timesync.css, and
   timesync.js until you are satisfied with the results.

10. Add links to the Project (project.ftl) and Collection
    (collection.ftl) pages to display "/timesync" in its own tab.

You're done!
